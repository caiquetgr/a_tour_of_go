#Columns explanation: 

BenchmarkFileLen1-12
The name of the benchmark, a hyphen, and the value of GOMAXPROCS for the benchmark.

25
The number of times that the test ran to produce a stable result.

47201025 ns/op
How long it took to run a single pass of this benchmark, in nanoseconds (there are 1,000,000,000 nanoseconds in a second).

65342 B/op
The number of bytes allocated during a single pass of the benchmark.

65208 allocs/op
The number of times bytes had to be allocated from the heap during a single pass of the benchmark. This will always be less than or equal to the number of bytes allocated.
